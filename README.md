# What is this?

Made this to test Webpack 2. It's a little React app. It's not the most minimal thing I could build, but it's fairly practical for my purposes.

# Tech stuffs

- Webpack 2
- Babel
- React
- Redux
- Redux-sagas
- React-Router v4
- CSS Modules
- PostCSS
- Jest
- ESLint (w/ AirBnB config)
